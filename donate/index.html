    <div class="story">
        <p id="bold">This fragile little boy is Hemanta Joshi. He's a soft-spoken, loving six years old who lives with his mother and 10 month old brother. </p>
        
        <p>Together, we can change his life.</p>

        <p> My name is Binisha Shrestha, and I am the mother of two wonderful children. During my visit to far-western region of Nepal called Bajhang, we met this boy in a school. While talking to him, we came to know that, he'd walked for two hours to go to school, in the mountains, just because the government school provides a meal before the class starts. I even saw he was putting extra (dal-bhat) rice and lentil soup in a plastic bag to take back home to feed his baby brother and mother. 
            It broke my heart. </p>
        
        <p>While going back home from his school, we asked for his mother and she came to visit us with her other child. Her name is Dhana Laxmi. 
            It was pitiful. We came to know that she is an outcast in her village and her own husband tried selling her in India and somehow she was rescued through Maiti Nepal and sent back to village, which further led to more banishment.  So practically she lives in nearby forest, where there is no help, no reach of the villagers. </p>
        
        <p>I have been fortunate enough to afford our children almost anything they need from health education everything but my heart breaks for this family.
            Now, we want to pay it forward to another special family: the Khatris.
            Other campaign is for Manju Khatri , who has three beautiful kids. One year, 3 year and six year old . Her husband died while being a porter for a tourist. He fell down over a cliff. Since then, she has been looking after her 3 kids all by herself. She works at other's home. </p>
        
        <p class="bold">But even with all of that, Manju looks the sweetest and happiest. </p>    
        
        <p>She looks after her children, sends them to school, goes to work for others in the village. All for the sake of her 3 children. </p>
        
        <p id="bold" style="line-height: 40px;margin-left:10%;text-align: left;">How your donations could help Hemanta and his family:<br>

            $100 buys a whole year of school <br>
