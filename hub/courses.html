                      <strong>MODULE 1: PHOTOSHOP DESIGNING</strong>
                      <p>This is the first phase of web development and one of the most important of all. It is because when a client approaches the web developer for the development of the website or web application, the first thing that the developer has to show is the 'design'. Web design is widely done with the help of designing tool called Photoshop, Fireworks. Using Photoshop, web designers design a mock up (an image file) which is basically the look and feel of the website. After the client finalizes on the design, only then the developer moves ahead to the next phase. The output of the first phase of web development is an image called 'PSD File'.</p>
                      <strong>MODULE 2: SLICING AND STATIC HTML DESIGN</strong>
                      <p>This is the phase from where the actual coding starts. The PSD file is then sliced using the Photoshop tools and then styled using the markup language called HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), or XHTML and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). More interactivity can be added to the website by using JavaScript and JQuery. The output of this phase is called static website or a web template.</p>
                      <strong>MODULE 3: WEB PROGRAMMING</strong>
                      <p>Converting static website to dynamic website is the most important and the most time consuming part of web development. Static website is not fully interactive i.e. the content of the website cannot be changed unless we manually change the content in the file where the code also lies. But this is a very difficult task for the non technical person. Even a slight error while editing the content can make the website look ugly. So the web developer has to develop the website in a manner that even the non-technical person can easily modify each and every piece of information on the website without editing the coded file. The activity of converting the static website into dynamic website is called Web Programming. One needs to have knowledge of programming languages like PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor) in order to develop a dynamic website. Using PHP Programming Language, a content management website can be developed. A content management website (CMS) makes it very simple to change each and every piece of information on the website. Most Web Professionals prefers to call this phase the actual web development. The output of this phase is a 'dynamic Website' or a 'web application'.</p>
                      <p>You can develop dynamic websites or web application using custom PHP programming or by using any Content Management Frameworks or any other PHP Frameworks.</p>
                      <strong>MODULE 4: SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)</strong>
                      <p>Finally after the website is developed and deployed the most important thing is that the website needs to generate business. Search engine optimization is another vital thing to be considered. SEO is not the final stage of web development. It starts right from the first line of HTML coding followed by best coding practices, quality content writing and formulation and other analytical approaches that makes it SERP friendly.</p>
                      <p>Web developers are professionals who plan and program websites. They are responsible for developing strategies and implementing them through writing programs using various programming languages. Web developers develop back-end of the website by integrating databases to produce the functional architecture of the website. Then front end (user side) is integrated into the whole system.  Sometimes, Web developers may need to work with content writer, user experience designers and product managers and need to undertake creative or managerial role as well. Web developers thus need to have updated knowledge of tools and technology to remain competent. Web developing is thus a challenging yet creative and grueling yet rewarding job.</p>

                  <h4>OUTLINE</h4>
                  <strong>MODULE 1: PHOTOSHOP DESIGNING</strong>
                  <p>This is the first phase of web development and one of the most important of all. It is because when a client approaches the web developer for the development of the website or web application, the first thing that the developer has to show is the 'design'. Web design is widely done with the help of designing tool called Photoshop, Fireworks. Using Photoshop, web designers design a mock up (an image file) which is basically the look and feel of the website. After the client finalizes on the design, only then the developer moves ahead to the next phase. The output of the first phase of web development is an image called 'PSD File'.</p>
                  <strong>MODULE 2: SLICING AND STATIC HTML DESIGN</strong>
                  <p>This is the phase from where the actual coding starts. The PSD file is then sliced using the Photoshop tools and then styled using the markup language called HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), or XHTML and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). More interactivity can be added to the website by using JavaScript and JQuery. The output of this phase is called static website or a web template.</p>
                  <strong>MODULE 3: WEB PROGRAMMING</strong>
                  <p>Converting static website to dynamic website is the most important and the most time consuming part of web development. Static website is not fully interactive i.e. the content of the website cannot be changed unless we manually change the content in the file where the code also lies. But this is a very difficult task for the non technical person. Even a slight error while editing the content can make the website look ugly. So the web developer has to develop the website in a manner that even the non-technical person can easily modify each and every piece of information on the website without editing the coded file. The activity of converting the static website into dynamic website is called Web Programming. One needs to have knowledge of programming languages like PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor) in order to develop a dynamic website. Using PHP Programming Language, a content management website can be developed. A content management website (CMS) makes it very simple to change each and every piece of information on the website. Most Web Professionals prefers to call this phase the actual web development. The output of this phase is a 'dynamic Website' or a 'web application'.</p>
                  <p>You can develop dynamic websites or web application using custom PHP programming or by using any Content Management Frameworks or any other PHP Frameworks.</p>
                  <strong>MODULE 4: SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)</strong>
                  <p>Finally after the website is developed and deployed the most important thing is that the website needs to generate business. Search engine optimization is another vital thing to be considered. SEO is not the final stage of web development. It starts right from the first line of HTML coding followed by best coding practices, quality content writing and formulation and other analytical approaches that makes it SERP friendly.</p>
                  <p>Web developers are professionals who plan and program websites. They are responsible for developing strategies and implementing them through writing programs using various programming languages. Web developers develop back-end of the website by integrating databases to produce the functional architecture of the website. Then front end (user side) is integrated into the whole system.  Sometimes, Web developers may need to work with content writer, user experience designers and product managers and need to undertake creative or managerial role as well. Web developers thus need to have updated knowledge of tools and technology to remain competent. Web developing is thus a challenging yet creative and grueling yet rewarding job.</p>

                  <p>Web developers are professionals who plan and program websites. They are responsible for developing strategies and implementing them through writing programs using various programming languages. Web developers develop back-end of the website by integrating databases to produce the functional architecture of the website. Then front end (user side) is integrated into the whole system.  Sometimes, Web developers may need to work with content writer, user experience designers and product managers and need to undertake creative or managerial role as well. Web developers thus need to have updated knowledge of tools and technology to remain competent. Web developing is thus a challenging yet creative and grueling yet rewarding job.</p>

                  <strong>MODULE 1: PHOTOSHOP DESIGNING</strong>
                  <p>This is the first phase of web development and one of the most important of all. It is because when a client approaches the web developer for the development of the website or web application, the first thing that the developer has to show is the 'design'. Web design is widely done with the help of designing tool called Photoshop, Fireworks. Using Photoshop, web designers design a mock up (an image file) which is basically the look and feel of the website. After the client finalizes on the design, only then the developer moves ahead to the next phase. The output of the first phase of web development is an image called 'PSD File'.</p>
                  <strong>MODULE 2: SLICING AND STATIC HTML DESIGN</strong>
                  <p>This is the phase from where the actual coding starts. The PSD file is then sliced using the Photoshop tools and then styled using the markup language called HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), or XHTML and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). More interactivity can be added to the website by using JavaScript and JQuery. The output of this phase is called static website or a web template.</p>
                  <strong>MODULE 3: WEB PROGRAMMING</strong>
                  <p>Converting static website to dynamic website is the most important and the most time consuming part of web development. Static website is not fully interactive i.e. the content of the website cannot be changed unless we manually change the content in the file where the code also lies. But this is a very difficult task for the non technical person. Even a slight error while editing the content can make the website look ugly. So the web developer has to develop the website in a manner that even the non-technical person can easily modify each and every piece of information on the website without editing the coded file. The activity of converting the static website into dynamic website is called Web Programming. One needs to have knowledge of programming languages like PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor) in order to develop a dynamic website. Using PHP Programming Language, a content management website can be developed. A content management website (CMS) makes it very simple to change each and every piece of information on the website. Most Web Professionals prefers to call this phase the actual web development. The output of this phase is a 'dynamic Website' or a 'web application'.</p>
                  <p>You can develop dynamic websites or web application using custom PHP programming or by using any Content Management Frameworks or any other PHP Frameworks.</p>
                  <strong>MODULE 4: SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)</strong>

            <p>Web developers are professionals who plan and program websites. They are responsible for developing strategies and implementing them through writing programs using various programming languages. Web developers develop back-end of the website by integrating databases to produce the functional architecture of the website. Then front end (user side) is integrated into the whole system.  Sometimes, Web developers may need to work with content writer, user experience designers and product managers and need to undertake creative or managerial role as well. Web developers thus need to have updated knowledge of tools and technology to remain competent. Web developing is thus a challenging yet creative and grueling yet rewarding job.</p>

          <strong>MODULE 1: PHOTOSHOP DESIGNING</strong>
          <p>This is the first phase of web development and one of the most important of all. It is because when a client approaches the web developer for the development of the website or web application, the first thing that the developer has to show is the 'design'. Web design is widely done with the help of designing tool called Photoshop, Fireworks. Using Photoshop, web designers design a mock up (an image file) which is basically the look and feel of the website. After the client finalizes on the design, only then the developer moves ahead to the next phase. The output of the first phase of web development is an image called 'PSD File'.</p>
          <strong>MODULE 2: SLICING AND STATIC HTML DESIGN</strong>
          <p>This is the phase from where the actual coding starts. The PSD file is then sliced using the Photoshop tools and then styled using the markup language called HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), or XHTML and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet). More interactivity can be added to the website by using JavaScript and JQuery. The output of this phase is called static website or a web template.</p>
          <strong>MODULE 3: WEB PROGRAMMING</strong>
          <p>Converting static website to dynamic website is the most important and the most time consuming part of web development. Static website is not fully interactive i.e. the content of the website cannot be changed unless we manually change the content in the file where the code also lies. But this is a very difficult task for the non technical person. Even a slight error while editing the content can make the website look ugly. So the web developer has to develop the website in a manner that even the non-technical person can easily modify each and every piece of information on the website without editing the coded file. The activity of converting the static website into dynamic website is called Web Programming. One needs to have knowledge of programming languages like PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor) in order to develop a dynamic website. Using PHP Programming Language, a content management website can be developed. A content management website (CMS) makes it very simple to change each and every piece of information on the website. Most Web Professionals prefers to call this phase the actual web development. The output of this phase is a 'dynamic Website' or a 'web application'.</p>
